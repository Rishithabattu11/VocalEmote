# üéôÔ∏è VocalEmote

> Detect emotions in real-time from your speech using NLP and deep learning.

VocalEmote is a Python project that captures audio from your microphone, transcribes it into text using Google's Speech Recognition API, and then analyzes the emotion behind your spoken words using a fine-tuned transformer model from Hugging Face.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview

This project combines **speech recognition** with **natural language emotion detection** to provide a simple interface for understanding how emotions are conveyed through speech.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Features

- üé§ **Real-Time Speech Input**: Captures your voice from the microphone.
- üó£Ô∏è **Speech-to-Text**: Converts spoken words to text using Google Speech Recognition.
- üß† **Emotion Detection**: Uses a pre-trained transformer model (`j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`) to classify emotions like *joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise,* and more.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Terminal Output**: Displays both transcribed text and detected emotion clearly in the terminal.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.7+**
- **[SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)** ‚Äì to process and recognize voice input.
- **[Transformers (Hugging Face)](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)** ‚Äì for running the emotion detection model.
- **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** ‚Äì backend engine for transformer inference.
- **Pretrained Model** ‚Äì `j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`
